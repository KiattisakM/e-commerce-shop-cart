# Session Context

**Date:** 2025-11-05 15:56
**Session ID:** 20251105_155658
**Version:** v1

## Goals
- Initialize Mahiro Lab Codex Integration (Level 3: Full)
- Set up project workspace with shopcart implementation
- Establish state management and session continuity

## Project Overview
**Project:** shopcart-by-claude
**Type:** E-commerce shopping cart system
**Status:** Initial setup phase

**Infrastructure:**
- Mahiro Lab Codex Integration installed (Level 3)
- All shortcodes operational (ccc, nnn, gogogo, rrr, lll)
- Git automation ready (/git:commit, /git:commit-push)
- State management initialized
- Background workers configured

## Completed
- ✅ Mahiro Lab Level 3 installed
- ✅ State directory structure created
- ✅ First context session initialized
- ✅ Shortcode protocol active

## Decisions Made
- **Architecture:** Using Codex orchestrator/worker pattern for complex tasks
- **Safety:** All scripts use danger-full-access in isolated dev environment
- **Commits:** Following conventional commits with emoji standards
- **State:** All session data persisted in .mahirolab/state/ with versioning

## Current Status
**First Session Started** - Project workspace initialized with Mahiro Lab Codex Integration

**Available Tools:**
- Direct execution: `.mahirolab/bin/codex-exec.sh`
- Research mode: `.mahirolab/bin/codex-research.sh`
- Background workers: `.mahirolab/bin/codex-worker-launcher.sh`
- Status dashboard: `.mahirolab/bin/codex-status.sh`
- Cleanup utility: `.mahirolab/bin/codex-cleanup.sh`

**Reasoning Levels:**
- `minimal` - Fastest (~5-10s) for trivial tasks
- `low` - Balanced (~10-15s) for most tasks
- `medium` - Default (~15-25s) for moderate complexity
- `high` - Deep reasoning (~30-60s+) for complex work

## Next Steps
- [ ] Define shopcart project requirements
- [ ] Create implementation plan using `nnn`
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Initialize database schema (if needed)
- [ ] Configure development environment

## Blockers/Issues
None currently - fresh start!

## Notes
- This is a Level 3 (Full) installation with all features
- Git automation available via slash commands
- Session continuity enabled with context versioning
- All state changes logged to execution_log.md
